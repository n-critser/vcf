#+TITLE: README

* A minimal vcard library in the spirit of the Practice of Programming CSV library

* Vcard or VCF is the format typically used for contacts in cell phones, calendar apps +++
  - vcard:  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard]]

* Library currently can:
  1. read a file from stdin or other file opening mechanism
  2. construct a tree from the contacts listed
  3. allows for a tree to be searched
     a. exact matches return a singleton list 
     b. non exact matches return a list of contacts
  4. uses an inorder interface introduced in the Practice of Programming
     - the interface requires a functoin pointer that is applied to each
       list element after calling applyinorder.

* License : 
  Since the current library uses eprintf.h and eprintf.c which are under 
  Lucent Technology copyright, the license is non-free. 
  Once all Lucent copyrighted code is removed or sufficiently refactored the 
  license will be GPL-3.
